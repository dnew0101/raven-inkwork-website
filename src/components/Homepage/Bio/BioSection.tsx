                    I prioritize a comfortable, collaborative experience, from consultation to final result. I offer a judgment-free space with amenities like fidget toys and design check-ins. I schedule ample time for breaks and adjustments, ensuring you never feel rushed. <br/><br/>
                    My style leans towards illustrative fine line and stipple, particularly flora and fauna, and dark/horror. While I'm proficient in traditional and blackwork, I'm eager to explore neotraditional and color projects. I tend to focus quietly during sessions, but I'm always open to conversation.

                        I was born and raised in Washington and have alway been fascinated with nature and animals, I even have an extensive collection of books on wildlife that I reference for some of my work. I also love to travel and learn about different cultures - even living in a foreign country for roughly a year. I love hearing about peopleâ€™s experiences and stories, as well as sharing my own. <br/><br/>

                        I practice many different forms of media for visual art including photography, painting, drawing, digital art, and more. <br/><br/>

                        As someone who is a part of the LGBTQ+ community, is neurodivergent, and struggles with extreme anxiety and ADHD I understand that the tattoo community may not always feel the most welcoming to everyone - and I want to change that.
